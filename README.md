# BlankSkyfor3p5
An illustrative example from Dessert et al. Science 2020 on searching for the 3.5 keV line in XMM-Newton blank sky data

This repo gives in example Jupyter notebook (`Jupyter/stacked_data_illustration.ipynb`) for analyzing the stacked MOS data from https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6485/1465 for evidence of dark matter decaying into a 3.5 keV line.  Please direct questions to bsafdi@umich.edu, cite the original paper if you use this data or these examples in a publication, and also keep in mind that the full data products are available at https://github.com/nickrodd/XMM-DM .
